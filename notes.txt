In this module (20) we were trying to extract an image from the request's body but the app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
does not work since bodyParser is urlencoded parser meaning it can only handle text values sent via the form and files are not text but binary data

Multer is another third party package that parses incoming requests for files and texts
Install it via: npm install --save multer
